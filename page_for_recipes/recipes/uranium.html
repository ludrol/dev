<h1>Uranium enrichment</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
    How to enrich uranium is a question for the ages. Below info is wrong. It just sound plausible

    <p>There are several ways to enrich uranium, but the most common method is through the process of centrifugation. 
        In this process, uranium hexafluoride (UF6) gas is fed into a series of connected centrifuges, 
        which spin at very high speeds. The centrifuges are designed so that the heavier UF235 isotopes, 
        which are fissile (able to sustain a nuclear chain reaction), concentrate near the axis of rotation while 
        the lighter UF238 isotopes move outward. By repeatedly cycling the gas through the centrifuges and separating
         out the UF235 isotopes, it is possible to increase the concentration of UF235 and thus enrich the uranium.</p>
